# JnU_eLibrary
JnU_eLibrary was an android-based mobile application program designed to digitalise the central library of Jagannath University, Dhaka-1100. This project was instructed by our honourable teacher, Dr. Sajeeb Saha. We designed this project based on the central library management authority's needs & focusing on their existing problems.
